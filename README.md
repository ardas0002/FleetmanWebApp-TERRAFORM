# devops-practice

Microservices project(code not mine you can find it at: https://github.com/DickChesterwood/fleetman-webapp) that is running with the help of Kubernetes on AWS EKS. The main target for this project is to deploy whole infrastructure with the help of Terraform and develop project in new iterations(only infrastructure side). For aggregation and visualizion of logs project use EFK stack. In the new iterations I am planning to add Grafana and Prometheus for aggregation of metrics and visualization of them, switch from manifests files to helm charts add other cool features that pop into my head in developing process.
